# Server-Navigator
Simple telegram bot that crawls through the Server's directory.

Written using Python, this bot will traverse the directory as you command it, similar to how unix commands work but for Windows. It was made to check files and directories of the server without having to log into it. It begins from the "D" drive but that can be changed within the code.
